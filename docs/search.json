Application execution flow can be sent to the most popular logging systems, available with .Net framework. Execution flow is integrated with diagnostic information coming by any components writing to .Net System.Diagnostic interfaces. Flexible options are provided to efficiently choose and filter the information to be rendered.\nBasic execution flow is gathered by means of compiler generated information (eg. methodnames are obtained with [CallerMemberName] attribute). Start and completion of methods and code sections are gathered by means of using statements with a CodeSection class.\nadd telemetry to your methods with the following instruction\nusing (var sec = this.GetCodeSection())\nwrite information to the listeners with the following instructions\nsec.Debug(\"this is a debug trace\", \"User\");\nsec.Information(\"this is a Information trace\", \"Raw\");\nsec.Warning(\"this is a Warning trace\", \"User.Report\");\nsec.Error(\"this is a error trace\", \"Resource\");\nCommon.Diagnostics component is supported on .Net Framework 4.6.2+ and .Net Core 3.0+.
