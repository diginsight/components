# Introduction

`Diginsight Components` include **observable** or **optimized extensions** for other technologies, achieved through integration with the **Diginsight** observability platform and **Diginsight Smartcache**.

Each component is designed to address specific functionality areas (e.g., authentication, database access) while maintaining consistent observability and diagnostics capabilities.

# Why Diginsight Components

**[Diginsight Telemetry](https://diginsight.github.io/telemetry/)** implements observability and diagnostics capabilities for .NET applications using **OpenTelemetry** and **Azure Monitor**. 

**[Diginsight Smartcache](https://diginsight.github.io/smartcache/)** implements optimized hybrid caching for .NET applications, combining in-memory and distributed caching strategies.

**Diginsight Components** are built to take advantage of these capabilities, enhancing existing libraries with observability capabilities and performance optimization, where possible.

**Diginsight Components** are built with a layered architecture that promotes modularity and flexibility. 

At the foundation, **abstractions packages** define core interfaces and contracts. 

The **core components** provide essential functionality like authentication and HTTP client configuration. 

**Technology-specific components** (like Azure integrations) extend the core capabilities for particular platforms. Finally, **presentation components** handle UI-related concerns.

This modular approach allows you to compose exactly the functionality your application needsâ€”from a minimal observability setup using just the core components, to a full-featured enterprise solution with Azure integrations, advanced caching, and presentation layers.

# What components are available

- **Key features**:
  - `IDebugService` interface for conditional debug operations.
  - Base contracts for other components.

## 7. **Diginsight.Components.Presentation**

- **Purpose**: UI/Presentation layer components.
- **Status**: Currently appears to be a placeholder (contains only `Class1`).


# Architecture Characteristics

Each component follows these patterns:

1. **Observability Integration**: Every component includes an `Observability` class that:
   - Creates an `ActivitySource` for distributed tracing.
   - Registers with the `ObservabilityRegistry`.
   - Provides consistent logging infrastructure.

2. **Modular Design**: Components can be used independently or together, with clear separation of concerns.

3. **Azure Integration**: Strong focus on Azure cloud services with built-in monitoring and configuration support.

4. **OpenTelemetry Standards**: Uses industry-standard observability patterns for metrics, traces, and logs.
